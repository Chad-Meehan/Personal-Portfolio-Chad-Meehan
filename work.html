      <P>
        This was a big year for our team, having just won our first NZ Hot Cross Bun competition, we put a team together to create 
        specialized baking entries in breads, pastries, cake, and creative catergories. I managed the team and worked on the design and 
        execution of all our products, and managed the delivery and finish at the live show in Auckland.
        </P> <br>
        <p>We won many medals in the contest and iearned enough points to be crowned NZ Bakery Of The Year.</P>

    <h3>New High-Spec Purpose-Built Bakery</h3>
    <p>This is the building development created for Kidd's Bakery.

    <p>I was on the team that designed the look and layout of this new retail and production facility in St.&nbsp;Albans, Christchurch. 
      I designed the production areas and retail spaces, and managed the instalation of new and existing equipment. 
      I also managed the transition and training of our team from our old smaller building to the new one.

          <h3>Rustic Films</h3>
          <p>This is the profile website of the Rustic Films production studio.
          </p>
          <br>
          <P>
            Rustic is the creation of my eldest son, George Meehan, a budding film maker and film student. He is passionate about all things film
            and has already made several short films with ever growing production values and quality. The site tells visitors about George and his
            continuing story as a film maker. There is a filmography page that lists all his film efforts to date, with a link to his Youtube channel, 
            and a contact page so you can message Rustic Films directly to engage their services or just find out more.

          <h3>Kidd's Cakes & Bakery Website</h3>
          <p>This is the website of the bakery and cafe that I am manager of. This site was created in 2017.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>I was in charge of working with the designers, <a href="https://www.learningarchitects.com/" target="_blank">Learning&nbsp;Architects</a>, to create the online face of the business.
            I had big input into the look and feel of the site and have since had the role of managing the content, pages, 
            and nav links as I began to learn all about how to maintain a website. This helped spark my interest in coding.

          <h3>Automatic Cereal Dispenser</h3>
          <p>This amazing device was a 2021 project made with my youngest son, Jack, 
            for his class end of year project.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>Jack and I spent many months designing, building, and refining the machine together.
            It is run on an arduino board with a motor that turns a bottle to feed cereal into your bowl,
            then a pump feeds milk from the fridge through a tube and into the cereal. Jacks next idea 
            is to attach an automatic spoon depositor into the bowl.

          <p>The video is being posted soon!</p>

          <p>This video was a short film submitted to the VFR 48Hr Film Competition. It took place while in lockdown in 
          2020 and was therfore a very restrictive film to make. This was a colaboration between myself and my then 20 year old son, George.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>The film had to be no more than 3 min and contain an echo and an arc shot. We drew sci-fi as our genre and between the two of us set about
            writing, filming, and editing the entire project in just 48 hours. This was a fun project to be part of and another step in the development
            of George Meehan as a film maker.
