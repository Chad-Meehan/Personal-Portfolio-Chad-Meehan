# Code Atributes 

This is an update at the time of the front page basically being finished and ready to be merged with the main.

There are a few different pieces of code that I found and used though I was not able to directly copy them and insert as it required changing to make it work for my site.

### Mobile Responsive Nav

I used code from a youtube tutorial to fine tune my nav and give me a few cool effects

### Mobile Responsive Flex Elements

I used mostly insperation from this youtube tutorial, it didn't fit very well with what i was trying to do but gave me a better understanding of the way to make the elements more responsive.

### Scroll Animations

I used another youtube tutorial to help me animate the different elements on scroll. I basically used the js code direct and used what I learned to input the css code I needed to run it.

### Setting Up JS For emailjs

To get my js code running properly to use the emailjs with my contact page I found some code written by  NJOKU SAMSON EBERE, a software engineer from Enugu, Nigeria.
